# Python Basic Socket Projects

This repository contains Python scripts focused on basic networking concepts such as:

- Port scanning
- Command and Control (C2) basics
- Socket programming
- And also some random games
- Extras(password generator, etc..)

These projects are part of my learning journey as a beginner in Python and networking.

> All scripts are created just for fun and educational purposes â€” not intended for any harmful use.
