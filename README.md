# Python Networking Projects (Beginner)

This repository contains simple Python scripts focused on basic networking concepts such as:

- Port scanning
- Command and Control (C2) basics
- Socket programming
 And also some random games 

These projects are part of my learning journey as a beginner in Python and networking.

> All scripts are created just for fun and educational purposes â€” not intended for any harmful use.
